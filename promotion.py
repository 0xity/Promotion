There are only three other commands, `/assign`, `/view_assignments` and `/remove_assignment`.

When using /assign, you can leave out the channel to default to the channel you ran the command in, or the message to default to a fallback message. In the message, you can use the following tokens:
**{user_mention} ‚Äî** Pings the user that got the role.
**{user_tag} ‚Äî** Writes the handle of the user that got the role.
**{user_name}** ‚Äî Writes the display name of the user that got the role.
**{user_id} ‚Äî** Writes the user ID of the user that got the role.
**{role_mention} ‚Äî** Pings the received role. **(not recommended)**
**{role_name} ‚Äî** Writes the name of the received role.
**{role_id} ‚Äî** Writes the role ID of the received role.

When using /remove_assignment, here are the possible parameter combinations:
**No parameters** to remove every assignment in the server.
**Role** parameter to remove every assignment to that role.
**Role** and **channel** parameters to remove every assignment of that role in that channel.
